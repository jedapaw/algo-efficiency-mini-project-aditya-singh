# Analyzing and Visualizing Algorithm Efficiency

This repository contains a detailed analysis and performance comparison of fundamental searching and sorting algorithms. The project was completed as part of the "Design and Analysis of Algorithms Lab" at K.R. Mangalam University.

The primary goal is to analyze, implement, and visualize the time and space complexity of common algorithms to understand the practical impact of their design choices.

## Algorithms Covered

This analysis includes the implementation, profiling, and visualization of the following eight algorithms:

1.  **Fibonacci Sequence**
    * Naïve Recursive `O(2^n)`
    * Dynamic Programming `O(n)`
2.  **Sorting Algorithms**
    * Merge Sort `O(n log n)`
    * Quick Sort `O(n log n)` (Average Case)
    * Insertion Sort `O(n^2)`
    * Bubble Sort `O(n^2)`
    * Selection Sort `O(n^2)`
3.  **Searching Algorithm**
    * Binary Search `O(log n)`

## Key Findings & Visualizations

The core of this project is the experimental profiling of each algorithm's performance. By measuring execution time and memory usage against varying input sizes, we can visually confirm their theoretical complexities.

The final comparative analysis clearly distinguishes the performance characteristics of different complexity classes. A logarithmic plot comparing the execution times of O(n²) and O(n log n) sorting algorithms highlights the superior scalability of Merge Sort and Quick Sort over their quadratic counterparts. All visualizations can be generated by running the included Jupyter Notebook.
